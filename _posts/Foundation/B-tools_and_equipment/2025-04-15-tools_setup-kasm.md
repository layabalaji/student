## KASM Workspace Setup (Ubuntu Noble / Kali)

Thanks to improvements in the KASM image, getting started is fast and simple.

Open a Terminal

### First-time setup

```bash
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate.sh # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
./scripts/venv.sh
code .
```

---

### After restarting a session

Open a Terminal

Your data persists even after workspace restarts or destroys. Simply relaunch your environment and run:

```bash
cd opencs/student
source venv/bin/activate # activate Python virtual environment
code .
```

---

### Version Checks (Optional)

Open a Terminal

```bash
ruby -v
bundle -v
python --version
jupyter --version
git config --global --list
jupyter kernelspec list
pip list
```
