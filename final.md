## MCQ Review

| # | Topic | Reflection |
| 1 | Swap Values First and Second | The code segment temporarily stores the value of one variable, then assigns the value of another variable to the first. The stored value is then assigned to the second variable. As a result, the original values of the two variables are swapped. |
| 3 | Identify use of citizen science | If data measurements need to be taken from many locations, it would be beneficial to have participants from around the world collect the data. |
| 9 | Benefits of incremental and iterative development | Gradually adding code to a program that already works can help programmers spot any new errors that appear. |
| 13 | Social media hypotheses | A noticeable change in user behavior after a system update suggests that the update influenced that behavior. |
| 14 | Comparing loop algorithms | Both programs display the same number of values, but each value in the second program is consistently one greater than the corresponding value in the first program. |
| 16 | Consequences of downloading licensed music seller |  If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA. |
| 18 | Predicting births with a computer model |  Simplifying a model can make it run faster, but it usually does not improve the accuracy of its results. |
| 20 | Finding the maximum value of three using MAX | The expression first finds the larger of two values, then compares that result with a third value to determine the overall maximum of all three. |
| 21 | The code segment moves the robot forward a set number of squares, turns it multiple times to face a new direction, and then moves it forward again to reach the target square. | 
| 22 | Procedure to determine the weather | This Boolean expression is true when the count of items meeting a condition exceeds half of the total number of items. |
| 24 | Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters | A transformation is considered lossless if the original data can be completely recovered from the transformed version by reversing the steps applied. |
| 26 | Completing robot code by adding if statement | The code segment repeatedly checks for open spaces to the right, moves forward when possible, and turns as needed, guiding the robot along a path to reach the target square. |
| 27 | Guessing a secret number | Inserting the command makes the loop stop as soon as the guess is correct, demonstrating how a condition can control when a loop terminates. |
