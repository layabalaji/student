## Introduction

This trimester in computer science, I learned how to organize my code and files so that my projects are easier to manage and understand. I also became more confident in navigating VS Code, learning how to use its tools to write, debug, and run programs efficiently. Finally, I improved my ability to collaborate with others, sharing code, giving feedback, and working together on projects, which helped me grow as a programmer.

## MCQ Reflection

| # | Topic | Reflection |
| 1 | Swap Values First and Second | The code segment temporarily stores the value of one variable, then assigns the value of another variable to the first. The stored value is then assigned to the second variable. As a result, the original values of the two variables are swapped. |
| 3 | Identify use of citizen science | If data measurements need to be taken from many locations, it would be beneficial to have participants from around the world collect the data. |
| 9 | Benefits of incremental and iterative development | Gradually adding code to a program that already works can help programmers spot any new errors that appear. |
| 13 | Social media hypotheses | A noticeable change in user behavior after a system update suggests that the update influenced that behavior. |
| 14 | Comparing loop algorithms | Both programs display the same number of values, but each value in the second program is consistently one greater than the corresponding value in the first program. |
| 16 | Consequences of downloading licensed music seller |  If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA. |
| 18 | Predicting births with a computer model |  Simplifying a model can make it run faster, but it usually does not improve the accuracy of its results. |
| 20 | Finding the maximum value of three using MAX | The expression first finds the larger of two values, then compares that result with a third value to determine the overall maximum of all three. |
| 21 | Comparing robot algorithms | The code segment moves the robot forward a set number of squares, turns it multiple times to face a new direction, and then moves it forward again to reach the target square. | 
| 22 | Procedure to determine the weather | This Boolean expression is true when the count of items meeting a condition exceeds half of the total number of items. |
| 24 | Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters | A transformation is considered lossless if the original data can be completely recovered from the transformed version by reversing the steps applied. |
| 26 | Completing robot code by adding if statement | The code segment repeatedly checks for open spaces to the right, moves forward when possible, and turns as needed, guiding the robot along a path to reach the target square. |
| 27 | Guessing a secret number | Inserting the command makes the loop stop as soon as the guess is correct, demonstrating how a condition can control when a loop terminates. |
| 28 | Text-editing application with binary sequences | Using 8 bits allows for 256 different values, since 2 to the 8th power equals 256. |
| 29 | Diagram with three logic gates | With these inputs, all gates produce false outputs, so the final output of the circuit is false.| 
| 30 | Video-streaming service by genre | Each call to the procedure takes one hour, and since it is called once before the loop and four times inside the loop, the program will take about 5 hours to execute. |
| 37 | Comparing code segments to compute average from list | Both code segments calculate the correct average, but the first requires more arithmetic operations because it divides by the list length inside the loop, whereas the second does it only once. |
| 40 | Computer science midterm and final grades | This option is correct because it shows that overall averages, changes in scores, and the proportion of students who improved can all be determined by calculating totals and comparing values before and after the policy. |
| 42 | Increasing bit representation for internet protocol | With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2³² possible addresses, and with 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2¹²⁸ possible addresses, so IPv6 has 2⁹⁶ times as many addresses as IPv4. |
| 43 | Runtime of algorithm for online retailer | The pattern suggests the algorithm takes n² steps for a list of n items, which is a polynomial, so the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. |
| 44 | Using a 4 bit representation for integers | With a 4-bit integer, 2⁴ values can be represented, allowing numbers from 0 to 15, so any operation resulting in a value above 15—like 10 + 7—will cause an overflow. | 
| 45 | NAND logic gate | The expression NOT(P AND Q) is true whenever P AND Q is false, and false when P AND Q is true, showing how negation reverses the result of an AND operation. |
| 47 | Encrypting and decrypting using public key cryptography | In public-key cryptography, a message is encoded using the recipient’s public key and can only be decoded using their private key. |
| 48 | Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials | This option makes the experiment succeed whenever RANDOM(1, 100) generates a number from 1 to 75, representing a 75% success rate. |
| 52 | Algorithms to identify palindrome words in list | Options II and III execute the steps in the correct order, because the "shorten" step must come after "keep palindromes" to ensure palindromes are identified correctly. |
| 53 | Purpose of maching learning programs | Machine learning is when a computer studies data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. |
| 58 | Defining Internet enabled crowdsourcing | The Internet can give crowdsourcing participants access to tools, information, and people across distances, but some problems are too complex to solve quickly, even with distributed effort. |
| 59 | Movie studio media librarian | Lossy compression produces only an approximate version of the original video, and the full-quality data cannot be recovered once it is compressed. |
| 60 | Managing complexity with abstraction | Using procedure calls for repeated code is an example of procedural abstraction, while organizing related values into a list is an example of data abstraction; both help manage program complexity. |
| 61 | Data about students at East and West High schools | The average number of days absent can be calculated from either data format because both provide each student’s absence count. | 
| 64 | Cloud computing and the Internet | Cloud computing enables easy collaboration and file sharing, but sites must also address security concerns to protect users’ private data. | 
| 65 | Correcting errors in procedure Multiply | If y is negative, the condition count = y will never be true because count starts at 0 and only increases. |
| 66 |  Test cases for procedure Smallest | The procedure returns the first number smaller than the first list element, so for [40, 30, 20, 10] it returns 30, which is not the smallest value in the list. |

## Self Reflection

## Night At the Museum Reflection

- Presented Types of AI
- People found the AI prompts interesting
- Got lots of postive feedback
- Overall: It was a good presentation with good content but we could have made it more game-like and fun rather than reading.

I liked how the visuals looked on the CSSE game and how they made it interactive and fun to play. The display and background was done very well and would like to attempt to make something like this sometime this school year.
